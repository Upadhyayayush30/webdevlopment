One of the trending domains under AI is Radiology. There is huge gap between supply and demand Curve especially with respected to the available radiologists. AI influences automatic diagnosis. Ample data is available to implement AI technology to make life easy.

Radiology is the first Food and Drug Authority (FDA) approved AI/ML application. Cardiology is another category that has received four FDA-approved medical devices and algorithms. AI/ML applications are used for medical devices apart from these there is huge scope for laboratory result interpretation tool in the field of internal medicine especially for diabetes.
